The zone ID should be from the table at the beginning of this form (i.e. 1 – 6). So, if the second livelihood zone is agro-pastoral, put a 2 against all sub-locations in the list that you would classify as agro-pastoral. Also indicate the number of the zone against the sub-location on the map that you have been provided. Make sure that you have indicated the main livelihood zone for each sub-location in the county.</string>
    <string name="lz_crop_production_question">In the table below, include all crops, both cash crops and food crops that are grown in the area.

Also estimate the approximate average yield in kilograms per hectare. Also provide a rough estimate of the percentage of the area that is under irrigation in each season.</string>
    <string name="lz_crop_production_question_section_two">Try to use specific crop names (like “haricot bean” or “wheat”) instead of general categories (like “pulses” or “cereals”).
